.SH NAME
drainage2cdf \- convert CLM drainage file into NetCDF file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B drainage2cdf
[\-var name] [\-compress level] [\-netcdf4]
.I soilfile.nc gridfile drainagefile netcdffile
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program converts CLM drainage data into NetCDF input data using the soil code NetCDF file. If drainage CLM file has 2 bands, then the second band is the length of the river and written as variable "riverlen" into the NetCDF file.
.SH OPTIONS
