Installation of LPJmL C Version 5.9.27

Installation for Unix-like systems
----------------------------------

This text describes how to install LPJmL on your system.
The code has been tested for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
with cygwin and Microsoft C compiler (sequential version without MPI).
Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows (http://www.cygwin.com)
On Mac OS the xcode suite must be installed in order to have the gcc
compiler.

create LPJmL directory:

mkdir lpjml

Go to LPJmL directory:

cd lpjml

untar source files

gzip -cd lpjml-5.9.27.tar.gz|tar -xf -

Configure for your operating system

On the PIK cluster you have to set the following modules:

module load intel/oneAPI/2024.0.0
module load udunits/2.2.28
module load json-c/0.17
module load netcdf-c

On a Linux system you have to install the NetCDF, Udunits2, and JSON-C library:

sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev
sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev
sudo apt-get install libjson-c-dev
and optionally the MPICH parallel library:
sudo apt-get install mpich

Then LPJmL can be configured via

./configure.sh

If configure script exits with message "Unsupported operating system",
Makefile.$osname is created from Makefile.gcc and probably has to be
modified for your operating system/compiler.
If the configure script finds a MPI environment a parallel version of lpjml is built.
The configure script creates a copy of the following OS-specific makefiles from
directory config:

Makefile.gcc         - GNU C-compiler settings
Makefile.icx         - New Intel C-compiler (icx) settings
Makefile.icc         - Intel C-compiler (icc) settings
Makefile.mpiicc      - Intel C-compiler icc and Intel MPI
Makefile.mpiicx      - Intel C-compiler icx and Intel MPI
Makefile.mpich       - GNU C-Compiler and MPI Chameleon settings
Makefile.win32       - Windows settings (used by configure.bat)

Compilation flags

Compilation of LPJmL is customized by definition of macros in the LPJFLAGS
section of Makefile.inc:

LPJFLAGS= -Dflag1 ...

The binaries can be copied in an installation directory by invoking

make install

The necessary parameter and include files will be copied, too.
The target directory must be specified by setting the environment variable LPJROOT:

export LPJROOT=<installation directory>


Environment variables

The following environment variables are used by LPJmL:

LPJNOPP        - disables preprocessor if set to "true", same as -nopp option
LPJPEDANTIC    - enables pedantic mode if set to "true", same as -pedantic option
LPJPREP        - defines preprocessor command for LPJmL configuration  file, default
                 is "cpp"
LPJROOT        - defines the root directory for LPJmL. This directory is added to the
                 include directories of the preprocessor
LPJIMAGE       - sets host where IMAGE is running
LPJCOUPLEDHOST - sets host where the coupled model is running
LPJWAIT        - sets time to wait for connection to IMAGE/coupled model
LPJINPATH      - Path appended to the input filenames. Only done for filenames
                 without absolute path.
LPJRESTARTPATH - Path appended to the restart filenames. Only done for filenames
                 without absolute path.
LPJOPTIONS     - cpp runtime options for LPJmL
LPJOUTPATH     - Path appended to the output filenames. Only done for filenames
                 without absolute path.

Create output and restart directory:

make test

On the HPC cluster at PIK it is better to create
input, output, and restart directories in the parallel GPFS filesystem /p/projects.
This improves performance in particular for the parallel code.

Man pages
---------

Manual pages for the man command are located in the $LPJROOT/man directory. Setting the
environment variable MANPATH to:

export MANPATH=$MANPATH:$LPJROOT/man

will enable help.

Invoking

apropos lpj

yields list of man pages related to LPJmL.

Running the code
----------------

Sequential version can be started by invoking:

./bin/lpjml lpjml_config.cjson

If you run lpjml outside the root directory of LPJmL, the following environment
variable should be set:

export LPJROOT=$HOME/lpjml

Then all includes are found. You can include the bin directory in the search path:

export PATH=$PATH:$LPJROOT/bin

Script lpj_paths.sh is defined in bin setting all environment variables. Put

. <Path to LPJmL root dir>/lpj_paths.sh

in your profile. Then LPJROOT, PATH and MANPATH are set accordingly.

Runtime options of lpjml

The following runtime options are defined:

-Iincludepath      - Adds include path for LPJmL configuration file
-Dmacro[=value]    - Defines macro
-h                 - print usage of lpjml
-l                 - print license
-v                 - print compiler used and LPJmL flags set
-vv                - verbosely print the actual values during reading of the
                     configuration files
-pedantic          - stops on warnings\n"
-ofiles            - list only all available output variables
-param             - print LPJmL parameter for soils and PFTs
-nopp              - disable preprocessing
-pp cmd            - set preprocessor program. Default is 'cpp'
-fpe               - enable floating point exceptions
-image host        - set host where IMAGE model is running. Option is only
                     available for the IMAGE version
-couple host[:port]- set host and port where the coupled model is running
-wait time         - set time to wait for connection to IMAGE/coupled model
-inpath dir        - input directory path
-outpath dir       - output directory path
-restartpath dir   - restart directory path

The first two options will be sent to the preprocessor.

For the parallel version SLURM files can be created and submitted via the bin/lpjsubmit script:

bin/lpjsubmit ntasks LPJmL_args...

Depending on your MPI version installed the program can be started interactively:

mpirun -np 32 ./bin/lpjml lpjml_config.cjson

Error codes
-----------

If lpjml fails an error message is displayed in the following format

ERRORxxx: message

where xxx is the error code returned. The following error codes are defined:

Error code Description                                   Error type

---------- --------------------------------------------- ----------

External errors are caused by invalid or missing input files while internal
errors are caused by problems inside the LPJ code. The latter will cause a core
dump and have to be fixed by program changes. Some errors will only be generated
if -DSAFE is set in the compile options of Makefile.inc.

Installation for Windows XP without cygwin
------------------------------------------

The code without MPI has been tested on Windows XP using the free Microsoft
C++ compiler and nmake. The Microsoft SDK has to be installed, too.  All necessary
programs can be downloaded from the Microsoft webpage.

Unzip the source and data files

configure makefile:

configure.bat

If the compiler does not find the system libraries, the library path defined in
Makefile.inc has to be modified.

create lpjml executable:

nmake
