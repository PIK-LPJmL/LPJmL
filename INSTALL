Installation of LPJmL C Version 4.0.002
=======================================

Installation for Unix-like systems
----------------------------------

This text describes how to install LPJmL on your system. 
The code has been tested for AIX, Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows 
with cygwin and Microsoft C compiler (sequential version without MPI). 
Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows (http://www.cygwin.com)
On Mac OS the xcode suite must be installed in order to have the gcc 
compiler.

create LPJmL directory:

mkdir lpjml

Go to LPJmL directory:

cd lpjml

untar source and data files

gzip -cd lpjml-4.0.002.tar.gz|tar -xf -
gzip -cd cru.tar.gz|tar -xf -

Directory tree after extracting the tar files:

Configure for your operating system

On the HLRS2015 cluster at PIK you have to set several modules for compilation and linking:

module load gmp/4.3.2
module load mpi/intel/5.1.1
module load compiler/intel/15.0.3
module load compiler/gnu/4.9.2
module load netcdf-c/4.3.3.1/serial udunits/2.2.19 expat/2.1.0

or you can simply load the lpjml module:

module load lpjml

./configure.sh

If configure script exits with message "Unsupported operating system",
Makefile.$osname is created from Makefile.gcc and probably has to be 
modified for your operating system/compiler.
If the configure script finds a MPI environment a parallel version of lpjml is built.
The configure script creates a copy of the following OS-specific makefiles from
directory config:

Makefile.aix         - IBM AIX settings (xlc compiler)
Makefile.aix_mpi     - IBM AIX and MPI environment
Makefile.gcc         - GNU C-compiler settings
Makefile.darwin_gcc  - GNU C-compiler settings for MacOS X
Makefile.intel       - Intel C-compiler settings
Makefile.intel_mpi   - Intel C-compiler and Intel MPI settings
Makefile.cluster2015 - Intel C-compiler and Intel MPI on HLRS2015 cluster at PIK
Makefile.mpich       - GNU C-Compiler and MPI Chameleon settings
Makefile.win32       - Windows settings (used by configure.bat)

Compilation flags

Compilation of LPJmL is customized by definition of macros in the LPJFLAGS
section of Makefile.inc:

LPJFLAGS= -Dflag1 ...

Flag                Description
------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
COUPLING_WITH_FMS   enable coupling to FMS
DAILY_ESTABLISHMENT Enable daily establishment 
DEBUG               diagnostic output is generated for debugging purposes
DOUBLE_HARVEST      adding correct sequencing of harvest events
IMAGE               include coupler to IMAGE model
LINEAR_DECAY        use linearized functions for litter decay
MICRO_HEATING       Enable microbial heating
NO_FAIL_BALANCE     lpjml does not terminate on balance errors
SAFE                code is compiled with additional checks
STORECLIMATE        store climate data in memory for spin up phase
USE_JSON            enable JSON format for LPJmL configuration files
USE_MPI             compile parallel version of LPJmL
USE_NETCDF          enable NetCDF input/output
USE_NETCDF4         enable NetCDF version 4 input/output
USE_RAND48          use drand48() random number generator
USE_UDUNITS         enable unit conversion in NetCDF files
WITH_FIRE_MOISTURE  enable moisture dependent fire emissions
WITH_FPE            floating point exceptions are enabled for debugging purposes
------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

Create executables:

make    

One executable in directory bin is created: 

lpjml    - LPJmL simulation code

Utility programs are compiled by 

make utils

The following programs are created in the bin directory:

lpjcat      - concatenates LPJmL restart files.
lpjcheck    - checks syntax of LPJmL configuration files.
cru2clm     - converts CRU data into file format suitable for LPJmL.
printheader - prints file header of LPJmL input data files.
lpjprint    - prints content of restart file to stdout.
txt2clm     - converts CRU data files into LPJmL climate data files.
              CRU data files have to be in the format specified in
              http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/~timm/grid/CRU_TS_2_1.html. 

The binaries can be copied in an installation directory by invoking

make install

The necessary parameter and include files will be copied, too.
The target directory must be specified by setting the environment variable LPJROOT:

export LPJROOT=<installation directory>


Environment variables

The following environment variables are used by LPJmL:

LPJCONFIG      - default LPJmL configuration filename
LPJPREP        - defines preprocessor command for LPJmL configuration  file, default
                 is "cpp"
LPJROOT        - defines the root directory for LPJmL. This directory is added to the 
                 include directories of the preprocessor
LPJIMAGE       - sets host where IMAGE is running
LPJWAITIMAGE   - sets time to wait for connection to IMAGE model
LPJINPATH      - Path append to the input filenames. Only done for filenames
                 without absolute path.
LPJRESTARTPATH - Path append to the restart filenames. Only done for filenames
                 without absolute path.
LPJOPTIONS     - cpp runtime options for LPJmL
LPJOUTPATH     - Path appended to the output filenames. Only done for filenames
                 without absolute path.
LPJOUTPUT      - Default method for generating output files. Valid values
                 are write, mpi2, gather, and socket. 

Create output and restart directory:

make test

On the compute cluster at PIK it is better to create symbolic links of the 
input, output, and restart directory to the parallel GPFS filesystem /scratch.
This improves performance in particular for the parallel code. 

Man pages
---------

Manual pages for the man command are located in the $LPJROOT/man directory. Setting the
environment variable MANPATH to:

export MANPATH=$MANPATH:$LPJROOT/man

will enable help.

Invoking

apropos lpj

yields list of man pages related to LPJmL.

Running the code
---------------- 
 
Sequential version can be started by invoking:

./bin/lpjml 

If you run lpjml outside the root directory of LPJmL, the following environment
variable should be set:

export LPJROOT=$HOME/lpjml

Then all includes are found. You can include the bin directory in the search path:

export PATH=$PATH:$LPJROOT/bin

Script lpj_paths.sh is defined in bin setting all environment variables. Put

. <Path to LPJmL root dir>/lpj_paths.sh

in your profile. Then LPJROOT, PATH and MANPATH are set accordingly.

Runtime options of lpjml

The following runtime options are defined: 

-Iincludepath     - Adds include path for LPJmL configuration file
-Dmacro[=value]   - Defines macro
-h                - print usage of lpjml
-l                - print license
-v                - print compiler used and LPJmL flags set
-vv               - verbosely print the actual values during reading of the
                    configuration files
-param            - print LPJmL parameter for soils and PFTs
-fpe              - enable floating point exceptions
-image host       - set host where IMAGE model is running. Option is only
                    available for the IMAGE version
-wait time        - set time to wait for connection to IMAGE model
-output method    - Method for generating output files. Valid values for method
                    are mpi2, gather, and socket. Methods mpi2 and
                    gather are only available for the MPI version
-inpath dir       - input directory path
-outpath dir      - output directory path
-restartpath dir  - restart directory path

The first two options will be sent to the preprocessor.

For the parallel version SLURM and LoadLeveler files for Linux and AIX are provided. 
A job can be submitted by invoking the bin/lpjsubmit script:

bin/lpjsubmit ntasks LPJmL_args...

Depending on your MPI version installed the program can be started interactively:

mpirun -np 32 ./bin/lpjml

Error codes
-----------

If lpjml fails an error message is displayed in the following format

ERRORxxx: message

where xxx is the error code returned. The following error codes are defined:

---------- --------------------------------------------- --------

External errors are caused by invalid or missing input files while internal 
errors are caused by problems inside the LPJ code. The latter will cause a core
dump and have to be fixed by program changes. Some errors will only be generated
if -DSAFE is set in the compile options of Makefile.inc.

Installation for Windows XP without cygwin
------------------------------------------

The code without MPI has been tested on Windows XP using the free Microsoft 
C++ compiler and nmake. The Microsoft SDK has to be installed, too.  All necessary
programs can be downloaded from the Microsoft webpage.

Unzip the source and data files

configure makefile:

configure.bat

If the compiler does not find the system libraries, the library path defined in 
Makefile.inc has to be modified. 

create lpjml executable:

nmake
